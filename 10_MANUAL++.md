C# is a programming laguage developped by Microsoft. It is part of the <span style="color:C9A176">.NET</span> framework

C# has been primarily used to build applications for either personal computers and mobile devices

---------------------
<br>

Computers are the hardware of a computer system. There are different types of computers such as mobile, personal, integrated, or supercomputer.

All types of computers are made of multiple devices that are also refered to as hardware, such as CPU, SSDs, screen, keyboard, etc.

If the hardware is <span style="color:C9A176">inside</span> of the computer, it is a <span style="color:C9A176">logical unit</span>. If it is <span style="color:C9A176">outside</span>, it is a <span style="color:C9A176">peripheral device</span>

| UNIT TYPE | REAL NAME ABV | REAL NAME | USE |
|-----------|---------------|-----------|-----|
| INPUT     |      -        |  -        | input devices are a family of devices that are used to give information to the computer. They can range from keyboards to USB drives or even touch screens and microphones |
| OUTPUT    |     -          |    -      | output devices are what makes the result of the computer's actions available back to the user. It can be a screen, audio, haptic feedback, etc. |
| MEMORY   | RAM <br> <br> SSD  | Rapid (Random) Access Memory <br> <br> Solid State Drive | It is the primary memory of the computer. Usually displayed in GB, you only need 4-8GB of RAM to have a good functionning computer. It determines how many things your computer can do at once. <br> <br> The SSD is the secondary storage unit of the computer, aka the archive system. It can come in the computer but can be expanded through USB, other Hard Drives or DVDs. They are usually labelled with a letter in the computer's explorer such as C:|
| PROCESSING | CPU <br> <br> ALU | Central Processing Unit <br> <br> Arithmetic Logical Unit | The CPU is the brain of the computer. It performs the instructions given from the inputs to give back outputs while also coordinating the computer itself. CPUs work in cycles (Fetch, Decode, Execute) mesured in Hertz (Hz). <br> The ALU is part of the CPU and performs the calculations and the decisions for the CPU. It also contains the logic gates. |

Computers <span style="color:C9A176">process data</span> through sets of instructions called <span style="color:C9A176">computer programs</span>, also called <span style="color:C9A176">software</span>


<br>

#### <a id="softwareIntro"><span style="color:#C9A176">01.02 SOFTWARE</a>
---------------------
<br>

the software of the computer is the sets of instructions for the hardware to perform a specific task.

software is 'written' (or coded) in <span style="color:C9A176">programming languages</span>, which are then <span style="color:C9A176">compiled</span> by the computer to translate them into <span style="color:C9A176">machine code</span>

Machine code (or language) is what the computer can actually understand. It is made of <span style="color:C9A176">binary code</span> and is <span style="color:C9A176">machine specific</span>, defined by the computer itself

Since machine code is specific to each computer, humans created <span style="color:C9A176">assembly languages</span>. Assembly is made of abreviations which concorde to one machine code instructions, which is later translated to machine code by the <span style="color:C9A176">assembler</span>. Assembly is the only programming language that is <span style="color:C9A176">one-to-one</span> with machine code.

While assembly is still in use today to create crucial parts of certain programs, it is cumbersome for humans to use. To help, we created <span style="color:C9A176">high level languages</span>, such as python, Java, JavaScript, C, C#, Ruby, PHP, etc. Those languages are much more closer to everyday natural languages such as english and contains <span style="color:C9A176">levels of abstractions</span> to help the programmer.
High level languages need to compile the code to run it, which takes time. When we deal with scripting languages (like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, etc.), we can use an <span style="color:C9A176">interpreter</span>.

#### <a id="OOPIntro"><span style="color:#C9A176">01.03 OBJECT PROGRAMMING</a>
---------------------
<br>

C# is an OOP language, or <span style="color:C9A176">Object Oriented Programming</span>. Most of the .NET framework is OOP.

OOP is a trype of programming in which we create objects and instances of those to do tasks.

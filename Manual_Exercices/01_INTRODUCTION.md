a) Computers process data under the control of sequences of instractions called <span style="color:C9A176">computer programs</span>
<br> <br>b) A computer consists of various devices referred to as <span style="color:C9A176">hardware</span>, such as the keyboard, screen, mouse, etc. 
<br> <br>c) Data items process by computers form a <span style="color:C9A176">hierarchy</span> that becomes larger and more complex in structure as we progress form the simplest data item (called 'bits') to richer data items such as fields
<br> <br>d) Computers can directly understand only their <span style="color:C9A176">machine language</span> which is composed only of 1s and 0s
<br> <br>e) The three types of computer programming languages discussed in the chapter are machine languages, <span style="color:C9A176">assembly languages</span>, <span style="color:C9A176">high level languages</span>
<br> <br>f)  Programs that translate high-level-language programs into machine language are called <span style="color:C9A176">compilers</span>
<br> <br>g) A <span style="color:C9A176">multicore</span> processor implements several processors on a single 'microchip' -a dual-core processor has two CPUs and a quad-core processor has four CPUs

<br>

a) Objects, or more precisely the <span style="color:C9A176">class</span> that obkects come from, are essentially reusable software components.
<br> <br>b) You send messaged to an object. Each message is implemented as amethod <span style="color:C9A176">call</span> that tells a method of the object to perform its task.
<br> <br>c) A new class of objects can be created quickly and conveniently by <span style="color:C9A176">inheritance</span>; the new class absorbs the characteristics of an existing  class, possibly customizing them and adding unique characteristics of its own.
<br> <br>d) To create the best solutions, you hsould follow a detailed analysis process for determing you project's <span style="color:C9A176">OOAD</span> (i. e., defining what the system is supposed to do) and developing a design that satisfies them (i.e., deciding how the system should do it)
<br> <br>e) Visual C# is <span style="color:C9A176">event</span> driver. You'll write programs that respond to mouse click, keystrokes, timer expirations and touches and finger swipes.
<br> <br>f) A key goal of Java is to be able to write programs that will run on a great variety of computer systems and computer-control devices. This is sometimes called <span style="color:C9A176">write once, run anywhere</span>

---------------------
<br>

a) The <span style="color:C9A176">CLR (Common Language Runtime)</span> executes .NET programs.
<br> <br>b) The CLR provides various services to <span style="color:C9A176">manage</span> code, such as intergrating software components written in different .NET languages, error handdling between such componenets, enhanved security and more.
<br> <br>c) The ability of a program to run without modification across multiple platforms in known as platform <span style="color:C9A176">independance</span>
<br> <br>d) Visual Studio is an <span style="color:C9A176">IDE</span> in which C# programs are developed
<br> <br>e) You can sell your own Windows Phone apps in the <span style="color:C9A176">windows store</span>

<br>

a) Software objects model both abstract and real-world things. <br>[<span style="color:C9A176">TRUE</span>]
<br> <br>b)The most polular database model is the *relational database* in which data is stored in simple *tables*. A table includes *records* and *fields* <br> [<span style="color:C9A176">TRUE</span>]
<br> <br>c) A database is a collection of data that's organized for easy access and manipulation
